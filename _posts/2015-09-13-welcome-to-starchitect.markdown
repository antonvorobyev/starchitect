Dear readers.

I am glad to present to you my new project.

Starchitect is weblog, knowledge base and source code repository. This all about 
software engineering and architecture. 

Why am I doing this? Over last years of my work I have accumulated a large amount of 
knowledge and experience in area of design, development, testing and maintenance of 
software systems. 

To date, I have lots of ideas for interesting notes and articles, useful from practical
and theoretical side. Also I plan to bring to public the development of various tools and
services, existing now as a personal pet projects or drafts, abstract ideas.

Now the moment came to finish this ideas and to share with you.

Some words about author. Initial author of Starchitect is Anton Vorobyev. I (Anton) am 
software engineer with a decade of experience with development using Java, JavaScript,
Semantic Web, SQL, Web Services and other programming languages, tools and methods.
 
I'll always be glad to communicate with you. You can write to me on e-mail anton@vorobyev.co.

Thank you for reading Starchitect.
